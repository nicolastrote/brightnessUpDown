# brightnessUpDown
A small script for increase or decrease brightness with a command line under Gnome 3.

# Installation
Download the script and move it under /usr/local/bin:
$ sudo mv ~/Download/brightnessUpDown.sh  /usr/local/bin/

Give execution rights with : 
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/brightnessUpDown.sh

# Usage
If your want to increase brightness:
$ brightnessUpDown.sh up

If your want to decrease brightness:
$ brightnessUpDown.sh down

# Notes
Even if Xbacklight is a general program for managing brightness, under Gnome 3 you need to use Gnome daemon "gnome-settings-daemon".
Enjoy and let me know if it improves your Gnome experience :-)
